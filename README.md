# LinkML Project Template

_A template for LinkML projects_

NOTE: You don't need to directly use this repository directly!

Instead:

 * [install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
 * [install linkml](https://linkml.io/linkml/intro/install.html)
 * run `linkml-ws new`

## Example:


```
mkdir ~/my-projects
cd ~/my-projects
pip install linkml
linkml-ws new my-project-name
cd my-project-name
# edit src/linkml/my-project-name
make setup
```

Type `make` to see a full list of options.

## Alternative protocol

You can also simply clone this repo and use it as a template, modifying files as you need - however,
this is no longer the recommended path
